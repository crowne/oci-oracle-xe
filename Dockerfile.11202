# Since: January, 2021
# Author: gvenzl
# Name: Dockerfile.11202
# Description: Dockerfile to build Oracle DB XE 11.2.0.2.
#              The Dockerfile supports building different flavors of images.
#              These flavors can be controlled via the build argument "BUILD_MODE" which
#              supports three modes, as follows:
#
#    FULL:     No database functionality is removed, just log and trace files from the
#              database installation  itself.
#              Additional required packages, such as 'gcc' and 'make' are installed
#              (needed for native PL/SQL execution, etc.)
#              Database configuration is as per default installation, except for the
#              location of the fast_recovery_area and redo logs.
#
#    REGULAR:  Following functionalities have been removed:
#              * gcc & make (needed for native PL/SQL execution, etc.)
#              * APEX
#
#    SLIM:     Following functionalities have been removed:
#              * Everything that has been removed in the REGULAR image, plus:
#              * Oracle Text
